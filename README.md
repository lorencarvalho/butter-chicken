## Marinade

* 1 cup - Greek yogurt
* 4 Cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp Fresh ginger, minced
* 1 Lemon, juiced
* 2 tsp Kosher salt
* 1 tbsp garam masala
* 3 lbs Boneless, skinless, chicken thighs, cut into 2 inch pieces

## Butter Chicken

* ¾ cup Brummel & brown organic buttery yogurt spread
* 2 Onions, chopped
* 4 Cloves garlic, chopped
* 2 tsp Cinnamon
* ¼ tsp Cayenne
* 1 tsp Kosher salt
* 2 tsp Cumin
* 1 tbsp Garam masala
* 1 tsp Turmeric
* 2 (28 oz) cans Diced tomatoes

## Method

In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, salt and Garam Masala until fully incorporated.

Add the chicken pieces and toss to combine, coating the chicken entirely with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 1-3 hours.

In a large pan set over medium-high heat, melt the Brummel & Brown Organic Buttery Yogurt Spread. Add the onions, stirring frequently until translucent, about 5-7 minutes.

Add the garlic and cook for another 2-3 minutes.

Add the cinnamon, cayenne, kosher salt, cumin, Garam Masala, and tumeric. Stir until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Add the tomatoes. Bring to a boil. As soon as the tomatoes begin to boil, turn the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.

Transfer the sauce to the base of a blender (this may take 2 batches depending on the size of your blender). Blend until smooth. Pour the sauce back into the pot, and add the chicken and all of the marinade. Bring the mixture to a boil, then again turn the heat to low and simmer, uncovered for 30 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
